# Presentation Timer Project

![Wiring Diagram](simulation.jpeg)

## ðŸ“„ Overview
The Presentation Timer is an Arduino Nano-based device designed to help presenters keep track of their allocated time slots for both presentations and Q&A sessions. It provides a visual countdown on a 16x2 LCD display, audio alerts using a buzzer, and visual warnings using LEDs. It also features Bluetooth connectivity, allowing remote control from a smartphone.

## ðŸ“Š Features
- Set **presentation** and **question** times **in minutes**.
- **Live countdown** displayed in MM:SS format on an LCD.
- **Yellow LED** blinks when 1 minute remains.
- **Red LED** flashes and buzzer sounds when time is up.
- **Bluetooth wireless control** via a mobile app or Bluetooth terminal.
- **Physical buttons** (SET, UP, DOWN) for manual control.
- **Hold SET button** to reset at any time.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Motivation
Managing presentation and question times can be stressful and distracting. This project offers a simple, robust, and wireless solution to help speakers stay professional and within time limits without depending on mobile phones or human timekeepers.

---

## ðŸš€ Future Upgrades
- Add a rechargeable battery.
- Use an OLED display for sharper graphics.
- Create a custom Android App with buttons instead of text commands.
- Add pause/resume timer control.
